        "\n",
        "This section is an explanation of the system you'll be working with. There aren't any problems to solve. Read it carefully anyway.\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem set will make use of a *production rule system*. The system is given a list of rules and a list of data. The rules look for certain things in the data -- these things are the *antecedents* of the rules -- and usually produce a new piece of data, called the *consequent*. Rules can also delete existing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, rules can contain variables. This allows a rule to match more than one possible datum. The consequent can contain variables that were bound in the antecedent.\n",
        "\n",
        "A rule is an expression that contains certain keywords, like IF, THEN, AND, OR, and NOT. An example of a rule looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "     IF( AND( 'parent (?x) (?y)',\n",
        "              'parent (?x) (?z)' ),\n",
        "         THEN( 'sibling (?y) (?z)' ))\n",
        "\n",
        "This could be taken to mean:\n",
        "\n",
        "   If *x* is the parent of *y*, and *x* is the parent of *z*, then *y* is the sibling of *z*.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Given data that look like '`parent marge bart`' and '`parent marge lisa`', then, it will produce further data like `'sibling bart lisa`'. (It will also produce '`sibling bart bart`', which is something that will need to be dealt with.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, the rule system doesn't know what these arbitrary words \"parent\" and \"sibling\" mean! It doesn't even care that they're at the beginning of the expression. The rule could also be written like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "    IF (AND( '(?x) is a parent of (?y)',\n",
        "             '(?x) is a parent of (?z)' ),\n",
        "        THEN( '(?y) is a sibling of (?z)' ))\n",
        "\n",
        "Then it will expect its data to look like '`marge is a parent of lisa`'. This gets wordy and\n",
        "involves some unnecessary matching of symbols like '`is`' and '`a`', and it doesn't help anything for\n",
        "this problem, but we'll write some later rule systems in this English-like way for clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just remember that the English is for you to understand, not the computer.\n",
        "    \n",
        "## Rule expressions\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a more complete description of how the system works.\n",
        "\n",
        "The rules are given in a specified order, and the system will check each rule in turn: for each rule, it will go through all the data searching for matches to that rule's antecedent, before moving on to the next rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "A rule is an expression that can have an IF antecedent and a THEN consequent. Both of these parts are required. Optionally, a rule can also have a DELETE clause, which specifies some data to delete.\n",
        "\n",
        "The IF antecedent can contain AND, OR, and NOT expressions. AND requires that multiple statements\n",
        "are matched in the dataset, OR requires that one of multiple statements are matched in the dataset, and\n",
        "NOT requires that a statement is *not* matched in the dataset. AND, OR, and NOT expressions can be\n",
        "nested within each other. When nested like this, these expressions form an AND/OR tree (or really an AND/OR/NOT tree). At the bottom of this tree are strings, possibly with variables in them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data are searched for items that match the requirements of the antecedent. Data items that appear earlier in the data take precedence. Each pattern in an AND clause will match the data in order, so that later ones have the variables of the earlier ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "If there is a NOT clause in the antecedent, the data are searched to make sure that no items in the data match the pattern. A NOT clause should not introduce new variables - the matcher won't know what to do with them. Generally, NOT clauses will appear inside an AND clause, and earlier parts of the AND clause will introduce the variables. For example, this clause will match objects that are asserted to be birds, but are not asserted to be penguins:\n",
        "\n",
        "    AND( '(?x) is a bird',\n",
        "         NOT( '(?x) is a penguin' ))\n",
        "\n",
        "The other way around won't work:\n",
        "        \n",
        "    AND( NOT( '(?x) is a penguin' ), # don't do this!\n",
        "         '(?x) is a bird' )\n",
        "         \n",
        "The terms **match** and **fire** are important. A rule **matches** if its antecedent matches the existing data. A rule that matches can **fire** if its THEN or DELETE clauses change the data. (Otherwise, it fails to fire.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Only one rule can fire at a time. When a rule successfully fires, the system changes the data appropriately, and then starts again from the first rule. This lets earlier rules take precedence over later ones. (In other systems, the precedence order of rules can be defined differently.)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Running the system\n",
        "\n",
        "The procedure\n",
        "`forward_chain(rules, data, verbose=False)` will make inferences as described\n",
        "above. It returns the final state of its input data.\n"

        "For the next problem, we're going to need a representation of goal trees. Specifically, we want to make trees out of AND and OR nodes, much like the ones that can be in the antecedents of rules. (There won't be any NOT nodes.) They will be represented as AND() and OR() objects. Note that both 'AND' and 'OR' inherit from the built-in Python type 'list', so you can treat them just like lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Strings will be the leaves of the goal tree. For this problem, the leaf goals will simply be arbitrary\n",
        "symbols or numbers like `g1` or `3`.\n",
        "\n",
        "An **AND node** represents a list of subgoals that are required to complete a particular goal. If all the\n",
        "branches of an AND node succeed, the AND node succeeds. `AND(g1, g2, g3)` describes a goal that is completed by completing g1, g2, and g3 in order.\n",
        "\n",
        "An **OR node** is a list of options for how to complete a goal. If any one of the branches of an OR node succeeds, the OR node succeeds. `OR(g1, g2, g3)` is a goal that you complete by first trying g1, then g2, then g3.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Unconditional success** is represented by an AND node with no requirements: AND(). **Unconditional failure** is represented by an OR node with no options: OR().\n",
        "\n",
        "A problem with goal trees is that you can end up with trees that are described differently but mean\n",
        "exactly the same thing. For example, `AND(g1, AND(g2, AND(AND(), g3, g4)))` is more reasonably expressed as `AND(g1, g2, g3, g4)`. So, we've provided you a function that reduces some of these cases to the same tree. We won't change the order of any nodes, but we will prune some nodes that it is fruitless to check.\n",
        "\n",
        "*We have provided this code for you*. You should still understand what it's doing, because you can benefit from its effects. You may want to write code that produces \"messy\", unsimplified goal trees, because it's easier, and then simplify them with the `simplify` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how we simplify goal trees:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. If a node contains another node of the same type, absorb it into the parent node. So `OR(g1, OR(g2, g3), g4)` becomes `OR(g1 g2 g3 g4)`.\n",

        "* If a consequent matches, keep track of the variables that are bound. Look up the antecedent of\n",
        "that rule, and instantiate those same variables in the antecedent (that is, replace the variables with\n",
        "their values). This instantiated antecedent is a new hypothesis.\n",
        "* The antecedent may have AND or OR expressions. This means that the goal tree for the antecedent is already partially formed. But you need to check the leaves of that AND-OR tree, and recursively backward chain on them.\n",
        "\n",

        "expansions.\n",
        "* The output should be simplified as in the previous problem (you can use the `simplify` function). This way, you can create the goal trees using an unnecessary number of OR nodes, and they will be conglomerated together nicely in the end.\n",
        "* If two different rules tell you to check the same hypothesis, the goal tree for that hypothesis should be included both times, even though it seems a bit redundant.\n",
